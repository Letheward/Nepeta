# Nepeta

Plugin for VCV Rack

## Module List

- BitMixer
- PolyXform
- Rotor

## Manual Installation

Copy the `Nepeta-<version>-<OS>.vcvplugin` for your OS from [release]() to your VCV Rack Plugin Directory (you can find it in Rack by clicking Help - Open user folder, and go into `plugins`).

## How to Use

See [`docs/Manual.md`](docs/manual.md).

The `docs` directory is included in the distrubution so you can view it offline.   
(in `Nepeta` of Plugin Directory after Rack decompressed the `.vcvplugin`)

## How to Build

Follow the [official instruction](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial) from VCV to build. (todo: need testing) 

However, I personally don't use the official setup (packages from MSYS2).  
I use a pre-bundled MinGW64 and manually installed every program needed to run the build system.
